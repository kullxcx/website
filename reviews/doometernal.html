      <h1>DOOM: ETERNAL Review</h1>
      <p>Ash Kull</p> <br>
    <p1>At first glance some might see Doom: Eternal as another game that needs to be brute forced by minmaxing weapon and gear upgrades; however, this is the ultimate strategy game. Whenever facing a challenging level, I had to plan the perfect route through the trial to minimize injuries and maximize casualties. Because of the strategy element, the game feels very deep and I always felt like i was improving at the game at a faster pace than my gear progressed. This is also helped by the gameplay elements like the movement and controlls being amazing. the Movment is the best i've seen in any game ever. Playing any other FPS game feels clunky because of the standard this game set for me. The only gameplay elements I neglected to use (possibly skill issue) were the grenades and fire spray. They seemed implimented well enough, but even very late into the game I just didn't need them. Doom: Eternal is easily the most fun game i've played since GTA V. </p1>
